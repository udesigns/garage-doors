<h3 id="when-that-happens-the-distance-your-garage-door-needs-to-travel-may-change">When that happens, the distance your garage door needs to travel may change.</h3><p>There are a few unusual factors that can cause your door open by itself. What can cause your garage door to open and close by itself? A garage door that keeps reversing when you attempt to close it with the opener might have a simple problem or a major issue that requires a service professional. Clean the button, as well as the connections in the housing, if this is the case. If the garage door makes contact with an obstruction while closing, the door will reverse, the opener will beep and the lights will flash 5 times. If your garage door is hard to open or reverses immediately after closing, the simplest thing you can do is check the threshold for anything that blocks it.</p>
