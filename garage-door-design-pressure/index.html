<p>In some areas (especially hurricane prone ones), a garage door must be able to withstand high winds, sometimes up to 130 miles per hour or more. Design pressures are the culmination of all previous components analyzed with door location and size. The design pressure rating of a door. Results in higher design wind speeds and pressures when strength design loads.</p>
