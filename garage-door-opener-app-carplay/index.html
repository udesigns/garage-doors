<p><strong>Garage Door Opener App Carplay</strong>, When i’m sat in the car inside my garage i’ve noticed my iphone switches over from wi_fi to 4g so i’m guessing the carplay works through wi_fi. The question is how to map them to homekit to see a garage door opener in the homekit app and the garage door icon in car play.</p>

My garage opener is too old to work with the buttons on the sunvisor and my clicker wasn�t working to well either so a few years ago i purchased meross smart garage door opener.
