Direct sunlight creates interference with the sensors and may keep.</p>

<p>When the yellow (amber) light is turned on on the garage door sensor, that means that the sending sensor is working properly. The sensors have to be aligned with each other and also have to be connected correctly to the garage door system in order to work. The sun light is so bright that the light cannot reach theother sensor..</p>
