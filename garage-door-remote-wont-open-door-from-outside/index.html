If the garage does not have an alternative access there should be a manual cable release which disconnects the door from the opener chain so that you can manually open it. Well the good news is it may be as simple as pushing a “lock button” or sliding it to the unlock position.</p>
<h3 id="to-unlock-the-door-press-and-hold-the-lock-button-for-5-seconds">To unlock the door, press and hold the lock button for 5 seconds.</h3><p>My garage door remotes will not open door from the outside unless you are right in front of the door.

Sometimes the door won’t close properly because of a poor signal from the remote to the opener. The wall switch led light will flash twice. If you had a garage door opener before with remotes, look in all drawers and in the cushions of couches and chairs for an old remote and remove the batteries from that remote.</p>
