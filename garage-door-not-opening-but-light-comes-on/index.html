<p>If the light usually comes on during a open cycle anyway. Garage door malfunctions can happen at any time. One common issue homeowners run into is their liftmaster garage door light not turning off. When the disconnect is engaged, the garage door will not open on its own.</p>
<h3 id="if-the-door-does-not-even-attempt-to-open-always-check-to-make-sure-the-disconnect-was-not-inadvertently-engaged">If the door does not even attempt to open, always check to make sure the disconnect was not inadvertently engaged.</h3><p>Find an outlet somewhere between the switch and the led where you can plug in a wall transformer to power the led. If the sensitivity is set too low or high, the door will not open. It does come on when the light button is pushed, when someone goes past the motion sensor in the wall control, or when the door is activated but does not come on when the door safety beam is broken. Energizing the wire to the light merely increases the noise, masking a weak signal. It�s also possible that the circuit breaker, fuse, or gfci outlet powering the door opener circuit has tripped or burned out. If your motor is still running but the garage door refuses to open, then you may have an issue with the springs in your garage door assembly.</p>
