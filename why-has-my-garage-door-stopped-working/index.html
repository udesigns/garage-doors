<h3 id="when-i-arrive-to-my-home-it-does-not-trigger-to-open">When i arrive to my home, it does not trigger to open.</h3><p>If there is an obstruction or the safety eyes are out of alignment, your door will open but it won�t close. The door has dislodged from its track. To help you troubleshoot your garage door issues, here are the top 10 reasons your garage door won’t work. Technical issues like power problems rising from the motor unit or the electrical outlet, faulty wiring between the motor unit and wall console unit, a faulty button or loose wiring at the level of the wall control or opener are some of the probable causes altering the operation of the wall. I own two craftsman garage door openers. It might sound obvious, but the most common cause of a garage door remote no longer working is a set of dead batteries.</p>
