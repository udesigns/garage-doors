<p><strong>Why Light Bulb Keeps Burning Out</strong>, Customer tells me that he keeps having to change the bulbs in twelve fixtures every two or three weeks. It definately sounds like a voltage regulator problem to me, we had a 97 xlt limited that was blowing all of its lights out, put a new regulator on it and everything was fine, i hated working on that sled because the owner did not keep up on maintenance and everything was in bad shape.</p>

<p>The longevity of your light bulb will depend on the type of bulb you have installed. This is one of the reasons they are so energy efficient. Constantly replacing headlight bulbs is not only an inconvenience and expense but also an indication that there could be an underlying problem with your vehicle. These loose connections increase the electrical resistance and the heat passing through the filament of the bulb , which can shorten its life.</p>
<h3 id="you-may-be-using-the-wrong-type-of-light-bulb">You may be using the wrong type of light bulb.</h3><p>I used a malibu transformer that has an output of 120 watts. With the presence of moisture, it will eventually accumulate on the light bulb surface and blowing will occur. This connection issue may be caused by how tight or lose you have screwed the bulb into the fixture. And if the circuit wiring were involved, other bulbs would be burning out too (from excessive ultra fast flickering). Customer tells me that he keeps having to change the bulbs in twelve fixtures every two or three weeks. This is usually the case if you’re using a bulb that is too large for your fixture or when you are using the wrong bulb in an enclosed fixture.</p>

<p>The light produced by the leds is not using heat. Halogen bulbs keep burning out. Powersuns are infamous for this and i did find a way to make them last.

<p>A bulb should be turned until it fits snugly into the fixture. The power supply voltage may be too high. You may be using the wrong type of light bulb. And if the circuit wiring were involved, other bulbs would be burning out too (from excessive ultra fast flickering). Wear gloves or use a towel when you change the bulb.</p>

<p>You may be using the wrong type of light bulb. This could be due to a wobbly ceiling fan or a rumbling garage door going up and down. Additionally, why do light bulbs burn out quickly? A light bulb can burn out quickly when it’s not screwed tightly enough into its fixture. Frequent fixture vibration beyond the norm, though, can.</p>

<p>If the light bulb that keeps burning out is an incandescent bulb, it might burn out due to vibration. The problem with light bulbs frequently burning out is that the copper tab has been over compressed. Bulbs may be loose or connected improperly. A lot of times the bulbs gather so much heat that rises to the hub and sits.</p>

<p>This is one of the reasons they are so energy efficient. So what would cause a headlight to keep burning out? These loose connections increase the electrical resistance and the heat passing through the filament of the bulb , which can shorten its life. The ventilation ports are clogged. Insulation in recessed lighting may be causing overheating.</p>

<p>The tiny filaments inside incandescent bulbs are fragile. There are many possible reasons why a light bulb burns out quickly: The power supply voltage may be too high. It should stick slightly out toward the opening of the socket. This could be due to a wobbly ceiling fan or a rumbling garage door going up and down.</p>

<p>But there are two reasons why your bulb may still overheat and burn out quickly : Excessive vibrations may be causing the filament to break. &gt; &gt;a poor contact causes heat. Needless to say, screwing the bulb tighter. The reasons for this could be many and varied, including jarring or movement, overheating, shorting, touching with the hand, fittings and types.</p>

<p>Sometimes, your light bulbs burn out due to a poor connection with the light fixture. It’s possible to screw a light bulb too tightly into a fixture. Additionally, why do light bulbs burn out quickly? Halogen bulbs and sealed beam headlights have very fine tungsten wire filaments inside that emit light when heated. Needless to say, screwing the bulb tighter.</p>

<p>I used a malibu transformer that has an output of 120 watts. Poor / loose connections when the circuit is not complete as it ought to be, chances are the excessive electricity will create more of an ‘arc’ and this means the electricity will not flow smoothly. Excessive vibrations may be causing the filament to break. There are many possible.</p>

<p>Excessive vibrations may be causing the filament to break. Additionally, why do light bulbs burn out quickly? I would think in that case it is just coincidence that &gt;it failed when initially energized or the filament weakened when it cooled &gt;and just �gave up the ghost� when powered again. &gt; &gt;a poor contact causes heat.
